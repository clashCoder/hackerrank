#Task 
#You are given a text file where each line contains a number. The numbers may be either an integer or have #decimal places. There will be no extra characters other than the number or the newline at the end of each #line. Sort the lines in ascending order - so that the first line holds the numerically smallest number, and #the last line holds the numerically largest number.
#
#Input Format
#
#A text file where each line contains a positive number (less than 100100) as described above.
#
#Output Format
#
#Output the text file with the lines reordered in numerically ascending order.
